For questions, please contact Mark Claypool (claypool@cs.wpi.edu).

This directory contains the data from the PuckHunt studies.

Directories are:

+ *mouse* - studies done with the mouse
+ *thumbstick* - studies done with the thumbstick.

The mouse studies have sub-directories for WPI and Oslo.  Each
directory also contains a "qualtrics" sub-directory with demographic
information.

For the game data, the fields are:

+ *Time* - when data was gathered
+ *Delay* - added delay (note - does *not* include local delay)
+ *Impulse* - force added to target (achieves a certain speed)
+ *Response* - the player's QoE rating (1-5ish)
+ *Elapsed* -  elapsed time (time to select the target, in seconds)
+ *Clicks* - number of clicks taken to select target
+ *Mouse* - total mouse movement (pixels squared)
