This directory contains the data from user studies on the effects of
latency on game actions.

Directories are:

+ *puckhunt* - studies done with the game "Puck Hunt" - the action of
  selecting a target moving with kinematics.

+ *motion* - a study done on motion parameters - the action of
  selecting a target moving with force-based physics.

data.
